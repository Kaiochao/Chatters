# The following variables define how your Channel Server functions when first
# starting up. Use these variables if you plan to run your channel through
# DreamDaemon, and don't wish to have to login to start your channel.
[server]
	; The name for your server. This is the name which will be
	; displayed on the BYOND hub for your instance of Chatters.

	name = The Lounge


	; The channel founder is usually set to the host
	; by default. Uncomment the following line to
	; set the founder to another key.

	founder = Crashed


	; Give your channel a brief description. This will
	; be shown alongside your channel's name in the
	; Public Channels list, and also to chatters who
	; use the /look command.

	desc = Original home of the lounge Lizard!


	; Choose your channel's default topic. Topics are
	; used to set the theme, or topic, of the chat, and
	; are shown in the channel window and by the bot
	; to new chatters who join your channel.

	topic = Welcome to The Lounge! Please make yourself at home.


	; Publicity determines if your channel appears
	; on the Network and BYOND Hub listings, or if
	; it is advertised to your friends, or not listed
	; or advertised to anyone. Public channels are
	; always listed, private ones are shown only to
	; your friends and watchers, while invisible
	; channels are not listed or shown anywhere.

	publicity = public


	; You can choose to lock your channel so that a
	; password is required to enter. Chatters wishing
	; to enter your channel must supply the password.
	; To lock your channel, set the follwing variable
	; equal to the password you wish to require for
	; chatters to gain access to your channel.

	;locked = myPass


	; Channel Servers can be accessed with a telnet
	; client. This can be useful if you are away from
	; a computer with BYOND installed, and wish to
	; login to a channel. Telnet clients appear as
	; the IP address of the client's computer when
	; joining a channel, but can alter their name to
	; a previously configured key with /login "keyname".

	; Hosts may require authorization before allowing
	; you to join thier channel via telnet. If you wish
	; that telnet clients should provide a password before
	; they may enter, uncomment the line below and set
	; the telnet_pass to your chosen password.

	telnet_pass = telnet


	; You can set the number of password attempts telnet
	; clients may have before being kicked from the server
	; with the telnet_attempts variable below. Set to 0
	; to allow unlimited attempts.

	telnet_attempts = 3


	; Your channel comes equipped with a channel bot.
	; You can alter your bot's settings, including
	; name, colors and spam controls, with the
	; following variables.


	; This is the name of your bot. Do note that to
	; distinguish bots from real chatters, all bot
	; names are prefixed with the @ symbol. You do
	; not need to provide the @ here, it is added
	; for you when you alter your bot's name.

	bot_name = Lounge Lizard


	; The following two variables define the color of
	; your bot's name and it's text. Use any valid
	; hexicemial RGB value, without the # symbol.

	bot_name_color = 360

	bot_text_color = 630


	; Your bot can be used to keep your chat free of
	; common spam attacks, by setting it's spam controls
	; to suit your needs. Your bot will kick anyone who's
	; not the host, founder or ops, if they violate the
	; spam filter settings you choose. If you wish, the
	; bot can also ban chatters who are kicked too many
	; times for spam. Use the variables below to define
	; how your bot treats spam.


	; This variable turns your bot's spam controls on or off.
	; When set to 1, your bot will kick chatters who violate
	; the bot's spam filter.

	bot_spam_control = 1


	; Spam is defined as repeating the same message over and over.
	; The spam limit determines how many times a person can say
	; the same thing in a row before triggering a spam flag.

	bot_spam_limit = 3


	; Flooding is defined as sending too many messages too quickly.
	; The flood limit determines how many times a person can say
	; something quickly before triggering a flood flag.

	bot_flood_limit = 3


	; The smileys limit determines how many times a person can use
	; smileys in thier messages before triggering a spam flood flag.

	bot_smileys_limit = 3


	; Max mesages determines how many messages it takes to trip the
	; flood filter.

	bot_max_msgs = 3


	; Min delay is the quickest time allowed between two messages
	; before the message counts towards the flood limit.

	bot_min_delay = 20
